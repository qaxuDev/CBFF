## Results
### ðŸ“Š Quantitative Results on WHU-CD and LEVIR-CD

The two numbers in each cell denote the **changed-class IoU** and **overall accuracy (OA)**, respectively.
Results reported under semi-supervised settings with varying labeled data ratios (5%, 10%, 20%, 40%). The highest scores are marked in \textbf{bold}.
